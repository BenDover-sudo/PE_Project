Imagine if you have a job where you're in charge of making and delivering cookies to your friends. You and your friends might make a special agreement, called a Service Level Agreement, or SLA, that says you will make a certain number of cookies each day and deliver them on time, or else you have to give them a treat or a favorite toy. This way, your friends know what to expect from you and you both agree on what happens if you don't meet those expectations. In a bigger business, an SLA might be used to make sure a company provides a good service and follows rules to keep things fair, and there might be consequences if they don't follow the rules.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":456,"completion_tokens":144,"total_tokens":600}}
